TITLE OF RESEARCH: Software development process optimization in Kyrgyzstan

SHORT INTRODUCTION:
Software development is rapidly growing activity that plays an important role in economic development of many countries of the world.
According to the XXX, unlike 10 years ago, today software development impact on world economy raised up to N percent. 
Particularly High Tech Park of Kyrgyzstan has raised revenue from "965 million KGS" in 2019 to "1 billion 165 million KGS" in 2020, regardless of the pandmic.
It all looks good, but there are still some impediments that cause high failure rate of Software Project development in Kyrgyzstan, such as 
treating intellectual work as physical, Misunderstaing of business logic and lack of standarts in coding architecture and deployment.
These problems have been faced by in many projects at some point, put it doesn't have to be.
Projects success rate can be increased by applying techniques, such as SCRUM, Agile and Kanban. 
Important here is to choose the most suitable for the team to achieve high quality results.


RESEARCH QUESTION/HYPOTHESIS:
1-Choosing suitable project development technique, decreases development time and increases success rate by more than 50%.
2-Working remotely with suitable project development technique, can be as productive or more as working from office.


OBJECTIVES:
To find appropriate ways to measure and improve the productivity of the teams and to discover to what extent the agile methods combined
with “soft skills” of the team affect achieving high quality results remotely and from office.

BRIEF JUSTIFICATION OF PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE:
Software development methodologies is popular among software companies, but because of some cultural aspects it is hard for some companies to adapt it.
After 2 years of working as a Software Engineer in Kyrgyzstan, I observed aspects such as software development is measured as a physical job.
It is one of the biggest obstacle to effective Software development process. To resolve this problem it is important for a company to have experts in SDLC, 
who can convince in effectiveness of agile methodoloies. I beleive this will eventually increase success rate of software development projects.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
– A qualitative and quantitative study, consisting in interviews with Scrum masters and online
questionnaires for scrum users will be done. This will help me understand to what extent the theories written in Agile methodologies 
apply in Software development process of real life organizations.
