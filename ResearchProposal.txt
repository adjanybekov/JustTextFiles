TITLE OF RESEARCH: Software development process optimization in Kyrgyzstan

SHORT INTRODUCTION:
Software development is rapidly growing activity that plays an important role in economic development of many countries of the world.
According to the XXX, unlike 10 years ago, today software development impact on wolrd economy raised up to N percent. 
Particularly it has raised from YYY KGS to ZZZ KGS revenue only in HTP for the last year in the Kyrgyzstan.
From here I colcude that it's effect is going to grow in the next 10 years, and effective of Software development will be the key to optimize the development of software 
as well as the effectiveness of software development.




RESEARCH QUESTION/HYPOTHESIS:
High failure rate of Software Development projects.
Company is getting wrong understang of client requirements.
One team member delay affecting whole team, and eventually extending deadlines.
1. Unclear Vision Between Project leadership and Developer
2. Poor Communication Between Team Members
3. Misjudging Overall Costs and Overspending

OBJECTIVES:
– The objective of this study is to find appropriate ways to measure and improve
the productivity of the teams and to discover to what extent the agile methods, the
integration of the lean principles and the “soft skills” of the team can be combined in order
to achieve high quality results. 

BRIEF JUSTIFICATION OF PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE:
SDLC is a good thing, but because of some cultural aspects it is hard for some companies to adapt it.
After 2 years of working in Kyrgyzstan, I see that it is same here... And one of the problems is that, Software project development is treated as if it is a physical job.
It is one of the biggest obstacle to effective Software development process. To resolve this problem it is important for an industry to have experts in SLDC, 
who can convince effectiveness by actions. I beleive this will eventually increase success rate of software development projects.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
– A qualitative and quantitative study, consisting in interviews with only Scrum masters online
questionnaires with both Scrum masters and practitioners, and statistics, will be done in order to observe to
what extent the views of the scholars and researchers apply to real life organizations operating in
software development industry.
