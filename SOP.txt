Hello!

My name is Azat Dhznaybekov. I am 21 years old. Right now I am 4th year student at the department of Mathematics in Middle East Technical University located in the capital of Turkey - Ankara. Although I will graduate this June, I want to continue education. Particularly I want to do it in the field of Information Technology and strengthen my engineering skills.

For this intention I believe that Universities such as Budapest University of Technology and Economics, University of Szeged, Universityof Debrecen is a good choice. To be sure, I reached some graduates of these universities, and of course we discussed pros and cons.One of pros is that they give focused, deep education in specific field. Another one is that they invest more time on practical side. And finally the environment is widely international, which allows culture and experience exchange. As a result of this and many other researches I ensured that enrolling to master degree in CS is a right step in reaching my goal, which is to become professional at information technology and engineering, and I hope that I will be accepted.

 Alongside with compulsory education, I like discovering technology and acquire new skills in it whenever I find time. For example by using mathematical background and fundamental programming skills, I regularly participate in coding competitions among Universities and online such as codeforces.com and ACM ICPC. As a consequence of this hobby so far I could get some honorable achievements in competitive programming, and got some work experience as a web developer, which give me more motivation to push it forward.

My future plans are big. Master degree wonâ€™t only improve my technical skills, but also it will allow to actively participate 
and maybe lead projects with wide audience. I beleive that the knowledge and skills gained from my university and work experience would make me a valuable member in the Masters program of Computer Engineering.

Thank you in advance for considering my application,

Best regards,

Azat
