Hello!

My name is Azat Dhznaybekov. I am 21 years old. Right now I am 4th year student at Middle East Technical University 
located in the capital of Turkey - Ankara. Although I will graduate this June, I want to continue education. Particularly I want to do it in the field of Computer Engineering and strengthen my engineering skills.

For this intention I believe that Universities such as Budapest University of Technology and Economics, University of Szeged, University of Debrecen is a good choice. To be sure I got feedback from some graduates of these universities, and
I found out that provide focused education on practical side. Moreover they are famous with their technical education.
This research ensured that enrolling to master degree in CS is a right step in reaching my goal, which is to become professional 
computer engineer, and I hope that I will be accepted.

As a field CS is also something I like dealing with in my free time. I regularly participate in coding competitions among 
Universities and online such as codeforces.com. And as for now I have made some achievements there.

My future plans are big. Master degree wonâ€™t only improve my technical skills, but also it will allow to actively participate 
and maybe lead projects. Although we have internet services are not very advanced in my country. AS an example, 
many services and one of them is transportation system has to digitalized. Tickets to the buses or trains cannot 
be purchased via internet. 

I also have worked as a Computer Engineer during last 2 summers and gained experience in Web Development and mathematics. 
I believe that this experience and strong mathematical background qualifies me for the master position at 
stipendium hungaricum program.
